### <h2>What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind</h2>

The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

<h3>Call:</h3>

The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

<h3>Apply:</h3>

Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

<h3>Bind:</h3>

Returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

### <h2>How do you create your own bind method using either call or apply method</h2>

The custom bind function needs to be created on Function prototype inorder to use it as other builtin functions. This custom function should return a function similar to original bind method and the implementation of inner function needs to use apply method call.

The function which is going to bind using custom `myOwnBind` method act as the attached function(`boundTargetFunction`) and argument as the object for `apply` method call.

```js
Function.prototype.myOwnBind = function (whoIsCallingMe) {
if (typeof this !== "function") {
    throw new Error(this + "cannot be bound as it's not callable");
}
const boundTargetFunction = this;
return function () {
    boundTargetFunction.apply(whoIsCallingMe, arguments);
};
};
```

### <h2>What is debouncing</h2>

Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new timeâ€”300 ms in the future.

```js
function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
let timer;
    return (...args) => {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = setTimeout(() => {
        func.apply(this, args);
        }, timeout);
    };
}
function fetchResults() {
    console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
}
const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
```

The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events

**Input:**

```html
<input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
```

**Button:**

```html
<button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
```

**Windows event:**

```html
window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
```
