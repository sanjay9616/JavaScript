<h1>JavaScript Promises</h1>

The Promise represents the completion of an asynchronous operation. It returns a single value based on the operation being rejected or resolved. There are mainly three stages of the Promise, which are shown below:

**1. Pending:** It is the initial state of each Promise. It represents that the result has not been computed yet. </br>
**2. Fulfilled:** It means that the operation has completed. </br>
**3. Rejected:** It represents a failure that occurs during computation. </br>

<h2>Async and Await</h2>

The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise</br>
The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.</br>
**Sync:** only one operation or program will run at a time.</br>
**Async:** Async means process operates independently of other processes means operations or program can run in parallel.</br>
