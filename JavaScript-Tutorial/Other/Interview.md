### <h2>What are modules</h2>

Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Why do you need modules</h2>

Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

1. Maintainability </br>
2. Reusability </br>
3. Namespacing </br>

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you get metadata of a module</h2>

You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

```javascript
<script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>;
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
```

### <h2>What are the advantages of module loaders</h2>

The module loaders provides the below features,

1. Dynamic loading </br>
2. State isolation </br>
3. Global namespace isolation </br>
4. Compilation hooks </br>
5. Nested virtualization </br>

### <h2>What is a post message</h2>

Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the difference between window and document</h2>

Below are the main differences between window and document,

| Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
| By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
| It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

### <h2>How do you submit a form using JavaScript</h2>

You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

```javascript
function submit() {
    document.forms[0].submit();
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you find operating system details</h2>

The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser OS details. Some of the OS properties are available under platform property,

```javascript
console.log(navigator.platform);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the difference between an attribute and a property</h2>

Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

```javascript
<input type="text" value="Name:">
```

You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

```javascript
const input = document.querySelector("input");
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
```

And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

```javascript
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
console.log(input.value); // Good evening
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is same-origin policy</h2>

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the purpose of void 0</h2>

Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an `<a>` element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.

For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

```javascript
<a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">
    Click Me!
</a>
```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language</h2>

es, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language</h2>

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript</h2>

No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Who created javascript</h2>

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are the steps involved in return false usage</h2>

The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,

1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour. </h2>
2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM </h2>
3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called. </h2>

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded</h2>

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is ECMAScript</h2>

ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

### <h2>How do you redirect new page in javascript</h2>

In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

```javascript
function redirect() {
    window.location.href = "newPage.html";
}
```

### <h2>What is an app shell model</h2>

An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are PWAs</h2>

Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

### <h2>What is a polyfill</h2>

A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is tree shaking</h2>

Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the need of tree shaking</h2>

Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

### <h2>How do you change the style of a HTML element</h2>

You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript

1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
```

2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
```

### <h2>What would be the result of 1+2+'3'</h2>

The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.

```javascript
1. console.log(1 + 2 + '3') // output 33
2. console.log(7 + 2 + '3' + 2 + 2) // output 9322
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Can I use reserved words as identifiers</h2>

No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,

```javascript
var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
```

### <h2>How do you detect a mobile browser</h2>

You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.

     ```javascript
     window.mobilecheck = function () {
       var mobileCheck = false;
       (function (a) {

### <h2>How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp</h2>

You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,

```javascript
function detectmob() {
    if (
        navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||
        navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
    ) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

### <h2>How do you get the image width and height using JS</h2>

You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions(width and height) using Javascript.

```javascript
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function () {
    console.log(this.width + "x" + this.height);
};
img.src = "http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif";
```

### <h2>How do you make synchronous HTTP request</h2>

Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript

```javascript
function httpGet(theUrl) {
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request
    xmlHttpReq.send(null);
    return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you make asynchronous HTTP request</h2>

Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

```javascript
function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
        callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
    };
    xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
    xmlHttp.send(null);
}
```

### <h2>What are the properties used to get size of window</h2>

You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

```javascript
var width =
    window.innerWidth ||
    document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
    document.body.clientWidth;

var height =
    window.innerHeight ||
    document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
    document.body.clientHeight;
```

### <h2>What are the ways to execute javascript after page load</h2>

You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,

1. **window.onload:**

```javascript
window.onload = function ...
```

2. **document.onload:**

```javascript
document.onload = function ...
```

3. **body onload:**

```javascript
<body onload="script();">
```

### <h2>Give an example where do you really need semicolon</h2>

It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

    ```javascript
    // define a function
    var fn = (function () {
    //...
    })(
    // semicolon missing at this line

    // then execute some code inside a closure
    function () {
        //...
    }
    )();
    ```

    and it will be interpreted as

    ```javascript
    var fn = (function () {
    //...
    })(function () {
    //...
    })();
    ```

    In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

### <h2>How do you detect a browser language preference</h2>

You can use navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,

```javascript
var language =
    (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox
    navigator.language || // All browsers
    navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

console.log(language);
```

### <h2>How do you detect javascript disabled in the page</h2>

You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

```javascript
<script type="javascript">
    // JS related code goes here
</script>
<noscript>
    <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
</noscript>
```

### <h2>What is an error object</h2>

An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,

```javascript
try {
    greeting("Welcome");
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>When you get a syntax error</h2>

A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error

```javascript
try {
    eval("greeting('welcome)"); // Missing ' will produce an error
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err.name);
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are the different error names from error object</h2>

There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,

| Error Name     | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| EvalError      | An error has occurred in the eval() function       |
| RangeError     | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
| ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference               |
| SyntaxError    | An error due to a syntax error                     |
| TypeError      | An error due to a type error                       |
| URIError       | An error due to encodeURI()                        |

### <h2>What are the various statements in error handling</h2>

Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors </br>
2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error </br>
3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors. </br>
4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result. </br>

### <h2>How does the synchronous iteration work</h2>

Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

**Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator. </br>
**Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.</br>
**IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.

Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,

```javascript
const iterable = ["one", "two", "three"];
const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }
```

### <h2>What is a decorator</h2>

A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,

```javascript
function admin(isAdmin) {
    return function(target) {
        target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
    }
}

@admin(true)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

@admin(false)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
```

### <h2>What is typescript</h2>

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

```typescript
function greeting(name: string): string {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

let user = "Sudheer";

console.log(greeting(user));
```

The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

### <h2>What are the advantages of typescript over javascript</h2>

Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language. </br>
2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.</br>
3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.</br>

### <h2>How to get the value from get parameters</h2>

The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

```javascript
let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
let url = new URL(urlString);
let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
console.log(parameterZ); // 3
```

### <h2>How do you print numbers with commas as thousand separators</h2>

You can use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation such as thousand separator,currency etc of this number.

```javascript
function convertToThousandFormat(x) {
    return x.toLocaleString(); // 12,345.679
}

console.log(convertToThousandFormat(12345.6789));
```

### <h2>What is the difference between java and javascript</h2>

Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,

| Feature     | Java                           | JavaScript                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Typed       | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language                         |
| Paradigm    | Object oriented programming    | Prototype based programming                           |
| Scoping     | Block scoped                   | Function-scoped                                       |
| Concurrency | Thread based                   | event based                                           |
| Memory      | Uses more memory               | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Does javascript supports namespace</h2>

JavaScript doesn’t support namespace by default. So if you create any element(function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

```javascript
function func1() {
    console.log("This is a first definition");
}
function func1() {
    console.log("This is a second definition");
}
func1(); // This is a second definition
```

It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespace will solve the name collision problem.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you declare namespace</h2>

Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects , IIFE to create namespaces.

1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation

```javascript
var namespaceOne = {
  function func1() {
      console.log("This is a first definition");
  }
}
var namespaceTwo = {
    function func1() {
        console.log("This is a second definition");
    }
}
namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
```

1. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.

```javascript
(function () {
 function fun1() {
   console.log("This is a first definition");
 }
 fun1();
})();

(function () {
 function fun1() {
   console.log("This is a second definition");
 }
 fun1();
})();
```

1. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.

```javascript
{
 let myFunction = function fun1() {
   console.log("This is a first definition");
 };
 myFunction();
}
//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

{
 let myFunction = function fun1() {
   console.log("This is a second definition");
 };
 myFunction();
}
//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.
```

### <h2>How do you invoke javascript code in an iframe from parent page</h2>

Initially iFrame needs to be accessed using either `document.getElementBy` or `window.frames`. After that `contentWindow` property of iFrame gives the access for targetFunction

```javascript
document.getElementById("targetFrame").contentWindow.targetFunction();
window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.targetFunction(); // Accessing iframe this way may not work in latest versions chrome and firefox
```

### <h2>How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically</h2>

You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style resources as below,

```javascript
function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {
    if (filetype == "css") {
        // External CSS file
        var fileReference = document.createElement("link");
        fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
        fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
        fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
    } else if (filetype == "js") {
        // External JavaScript file
        var fileReference = document.createElement("script");
        fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
        fileReference.setAttribute("src", filename);
    }
    if (typeof fileReference != "undefined")
        document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileReference);
}
```

### <h2>What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM</h2>

If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id </br>
2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name </br>
3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name </br>

### <h2>What is jQuery</h2>

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
    // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
    alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
});
```

**Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

### <h2>What is V8 JavaScript engine</h2>

V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.

**Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Why do we call javascript as dynamic language</h2>

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

```javascript
let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = "old"; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean
```

### <h2>How to set the cursor to wait</h2>

The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property "cursor". Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
    window.document.body.style.cursor = "wait";
}
```

and this function invoked on page load

```html
<body onload="myFunction()"></body>
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are tagged templates</h2>

Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

```javascript
var user1 = "John";
var skill1 = "JavaScript";
var experience1 = 15;

var user2 = "Kane";
var skill2 = "JavaScript";
var experience2 = 5;

function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
    var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
    var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
    var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

    var expertiseStr;
    if (experienceExp > 10) {
        expertiseStr = "expert developer";
    } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
        expertiseStr = "senior developer";
    } else {
        expertiseStr = "junior developer";
    }

    return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
}

var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;
var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;

console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
```

### <h2>What are dynamic imports</h2>

The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.

The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

```javascript
import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are the use cases for dynamic imports</h2>

Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,

1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser

```javascript
if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
   import(···)
   .then(···);
}
```

1. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.

```javascript
import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);
```

2. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is collation</h2>

Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,

1. **Comparison:**

```javascript
var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
console.log(l10nDE.compare("ä", "z") === -1); // true
console.log(l10nSV.compare("ä", "z") === +1); // true
```

2. **Sorting:**

```javascript
var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)); // [ "a", "ä", "z" ]
console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)); // [ "a", "z", "ä" ]
```

### <h2>Is PostMessage secure</h2>

Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard</h2>

The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

```javascript
targetWindow.postMessage(message, "*");
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers</h2>

Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),

```javascript
//Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
window.addEventListener("message", function(message) {
    if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)) {
        console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
    }
)
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Can I avoid using postMessages completely</h2>

You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Is postMessages synchronous</h2>

The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

### <h2>What paradigm is Javascript</h2>

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the difference between internal and external javascript</h2>

**Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag. </br>
**External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag. </br>

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>Is JavaScript faster than server side script</h2>

Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you get the status of a checkbox</h2>

You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `true` it means the checkbox is checked, otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below:

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="checkboxname" value="Agree" /> Agree the
conditions<br />
```

```javascript
console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>How do you convert character to ASCII code</h2>

You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,

```javascript
"ABC".charCodeAt(0); // returns 65
```

Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

```javascript
String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns 'ABC'
```

### <h2>What is the purpose of Error object</h2>

The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

```javascript
new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
```

You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

```javascript
try {
if (withdraw > balance)
    throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
} catch (e) {
console.log(e.name + ": " + e.message);
}
```

### <h2>What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy</h2>

There are two ways to copy an object,

**Shallow Copy:**
Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

**Example**

```javascript
var empDetails = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    expertise: "Software Developer",
};
```

to create a duplicate

```javascript
var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
```

if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

```javascript
empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
```

The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

**Deep copy:**
A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

**Example**

```javascript
var empDetails = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    expertise: "Software Developer",
};
```

Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

```javascript
var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
    name: empDetails.name,
    age: empDetails.age,
    expertise: empDetails.expertise,
};
```

Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

### <h2>Does javascript uses mixins</h2>

Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one `[[prototype]]` for an object.

But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.

Say for instance, we've two classes `User` and `CleanRoom`. Suppose we need to add `CleanRoom` functionality to `User`, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.

```javascript
// mixin
let cleanRoomMixin = {
    cleanRoom() {
        alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);
    },
    sayBye() {
        alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
    },
};

// usage:
class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

// now User can clean the room
new User("Dude").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!
```

### <h2>What is the difference between reflow and repaint</h2>

A _repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

### <h2>How do you create copy to clipboard button</h2>

You need to select the content(using .select() method) of the input element and execute the copy command with execCommand (i.e, execCommand('copy')). You can also execute other system commands like cut and paste.

```javascript
document.querySelector("#copy-button").onclick = function () {

    document.querySelector("#copy-input").select(); // Select the content

    document.execCommand("copy"); // Copy to the clipboard
};
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the easiest multi condition checking</h2>

You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.

```javascript
// Verbose approach
if (
    input === "first" ||
    input === 1 ||
    input === "second" ||
    input === 2
) {
someFunction();
}
// Shortcut
if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
    someFunction();
}
```

### <h2>How do you capture browser back button</h2>

The `beforeunload` event is triggered when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
    console.log('Clicked browser back button');
});
```

You can also use `popstate` event to detect the browser back button. 
**Note:** The history entry has been activated using `history.pushState` method.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
    console.log('Clicked browser back button');
    box.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
});

const box = document.getElementById('div');

box.addEventListener('click', () => {
    box.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
    window.history.pushState({}, null, null);
});
```

In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking the browser back button using `popstate` event handler. The `state` property of `popstate` contains the copy of history entry's state object.

### <h2>How do you disable right click in the web page</h2>

The right click on the page can be disabled by returning false from the `oncontextmenu` attribute on the body element.

```html
<body oncontextmenu="return false;"></body>
```

### <h2>What is AJAX</h2>

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

### <h2>What is web speech API</h2>

Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,

1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.
  The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,

```javascript
window.SpeechRecognition =
 window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
 // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
 const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
 console.log(speechToText);
};
recognition.start();
```

In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

1. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
  For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,

```javascript
if ("speechSynthesis" in window) {
 var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
 speech.lang = "en-US";
 window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
}
```

The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
**Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

### <h2>How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers</h2>

You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

### <h2>What is microtask</h2>

Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until the microtask queue is empty.

The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

**Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is the purpose of queueMicrotask</h2>

The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.

Example:

```javascript
console.log("Start"); //1

queueMicrotask(() => {
    console.log("Inside microtask"); // 3
});

console.log("End"); //2
```

By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.

### <h2>How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file</h2>

It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in our TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

```javascript
declare var customLibrary;
```

In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

```javascript
var customLibrary: any;
```

### <h2>What is heap</h2>

Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

### <h2>What is a microTask queue</h2>

Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue. </br>
The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

### <h2>What is the difference between shim and polyfill</h2>

A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9). </br>
Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

### <h2>What is babel</h2>

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

1. Transform syntax </br>
2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill) </br>
3. Source code transformations (or codemods) </br>

### <h2>Is Node.js completely single threaded</h2>

Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

### <h2>What is a Short circuit condition</h2>

Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,

```javascript
if (authenticate) {
    loginToPorta();
}
```

Since the javascript logical operators evaluated from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator

```javascript
authenticate && loginToPorta();
```

### <h2>What are the built-in iterables</h2>

Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

1. Arrays and TypedArrays </br>
2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points </br>
3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs </br>
4. Sets: iterates over their elements </br>
5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions </br>
6. DOM collection such as NodeList </br>

### <h2>Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases</h2>

You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

```js
const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
    switch (true) {
        case temp < 0:
        return "freezing";
        case temp < 10:
        return "cold";
        case temp < 24:
        return "cool";
        default:
        return "unknown";
    }
})(10);
```

### <h2>How do you create custom HTML element</h2>

The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,

1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.
  After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.
  **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.
  ```javascript
  class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      this.innerHTML = "This is a custom element";
    }
  }
  customElements.define("custom-element", CustomElement);
  ```
1. **Use custome element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.

```javascript
  <body>
       <custom-element>
  </body>
```

### <h2>What is optional chaining</h2>

According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.

```js
const adventurer = {
    name: "Alice",
    cat: {
        name: "Dinah",
    },
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName);
// expected output: undefined

console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());
// expected output: undefined
```

### <h2>What is an environment record</h2>

According to ECMAScript specification 262 (9.1):

> [Environment Record](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-environment-records) is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code.

Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.

Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.

### <h2>What are the possible side-effects in javascript</h2>

A side effect is the modification of the state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects make our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which make function impure,

- Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.
- DOM manipulations
- Mutating the input data
- Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert()
- Fetching the current time
- Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object

### <h2>What is RxJS</h2>

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for implementing reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### <h2>What is an observable</h2>

An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.
     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable

```javascript
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        observer.next("Message from a Observable!");
    }, 3000);
});

observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

**Note:** Observables are not part of the JavaScript language yet but they are being proposed to be added to the language

### <h2>What are the common use cases of observables</h2>

Some of the most common use cases of observables are web sockets with push notifications, user input changes, repeating intervals, etc
