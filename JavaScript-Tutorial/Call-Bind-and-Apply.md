<h1>Call, Apply and Bind</h1>

The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

<h2>Call:</h2>

The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

<h2>Apply:</h2>

Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

<h2>Bind:</h2>

Returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments.

**Example**

```javascript
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
   console.log(greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().
