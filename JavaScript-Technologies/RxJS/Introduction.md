<h1>What is RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)</h1>

`What is RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables that make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback based code.`

RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using obervable sequence. It provides one core type, the `observables`, `setalite types` (**Observer**, **Schedulers**, **Subjects**) and `operations` inspired by Array-extras (map, filter, reduce, every etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections

Rxjs consists of main 3 thing </br>
1. Observable </br>
2. Setalite data type (Observers, Schedulers, Subjects) </br>
3. Operators (Array methods - map, filter, reduce etc) </br>

**Observables:** An observables ia producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observer(Consumer).

**Subscriber:** It will listen to the Observable for data changes/updates.

**Reactive Programming:** Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data stream and propogation of change.
